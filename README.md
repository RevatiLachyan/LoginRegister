# LoginRegister
This project implements a simple login and registration page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to log in or sign up for an account.

Key Features:

The page consists of a header section with a login button and a main section containing the login and signup forms.
Clicking the login button reveals the login form, allowing users to enter their email and password.
The login form includes a "Remember me" checkbox and a "Forgot password?" link.
Users can switch to the signup form by clicking the "Sign up" link in the login form or the "Sign up" button in the header.
The signup form prompts users to provide their email and create a password. It includes fields for re-entering the password.
Both forms include eye icons to toggle password visibility for enhanced user experience.
Upon submission, the forms currently do not perform any backend processing. They can be further enhanced to handle form validation and submission to a server for user registration and authentication.
This project is a static implementation, serving as a starting point for building a more robust authentication system. Developers can extend the functionality by integrating server-side code, such as PHP, Python, or Node.js, to handle form submissions and database interactions for user management.
